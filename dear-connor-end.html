                        <p>I wake up <br>
                            the early morning light creeps in<br>
                            your peaceful existence draws me closer <br>
                            as I lean over and touch your skin <br>
                            waves roll over me <br>
                            I reach further <br>
                            holding you tight <br>
                            everything else falls away <br>
                            <br>
                            I love you so much my Con <br>
                            I love each moment we spend together <br>
                            in the waves <br>
                            amongst the trees <br>
                            under the Stars <br>
                            squished into our little van bed <br>
                            <br>
                            I love how you are fiercely loyal to those you love <br>
                            I love how you give your love freely and openly <br>
                            the energy that surrounds you fills the air with magnetism <br>
                            bringing everyone closer <br>
                            <br>
                            I love how you dive head first towards your goals <br>
                            I love how you pursue them unabashedly <br>
                            without fear <br>
                            drawn by passion <br>
                            <br>
                            I love you for being the strongest wahine around<br>
                            I love you for being able to be vulnerable <br>
                            this makes you so powerful <br>
                            but you already know that <br>
                            I love that you know that <br>
                            <br>
                            I love how it feels to hold you close <br>
                            I love how it feels to hold your body against mine <br>
                            moments of pure connection <br>
                            all of the physical world has disappeared <br>
                            we are lost <br>
                            together <br>
                            bound by love <br>
                            existing <br>
                            only to share <br>
                            love and pleasure <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In every moment we share together whether it be joyful, exciting, boring, painful or
                            tumultuous. There is love, and it makes it all ok. The last 4 years have been eventful and
                            painful, but you have made them the best period of my life, your presence, your energy, your
                            love.
